<h1>This is the perspective from the entrance of the U.S. Consulate<br>October 1,2020 8:02 AM</h1>


<p style="color:#EEEEEE; width:1500px" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#111111'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#EEEEEE'">This is a photo I took while standing in front of the US Consulate. In the consulate, I saw a large portrait of Pompeo, but not Trump. During that time, the Chinese government and Pompeo fought indiscriminately. Pompeo said that the Chinese Communist Party is a gangster, and then the Chinese Communist Party backlashed Pompeo is the public enemy of mankind through CCTVâ€™s news broadcasts. I don't know what they are doing, I just want to get my visa and go to school.</p>
