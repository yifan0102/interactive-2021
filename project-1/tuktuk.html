<h1>Tuk-Tuks<br>September 29,2020 4:08 PM</h1>


<p style="color:#EEEEEE; width:340px" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#111111'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#EEEEEE'">Tuk-tuks, two-wheeled carriages pulled by motorbikes that can fit anywhere from two people to entire families, are a ubiquitous sight throughout Cambodia. While the official name is remorque, or “trailer” in French, they are colloquially known as tuk-tuks, paying homage to their Thai counterparts.</p>
