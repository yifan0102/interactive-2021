          James Turrell Raemar, Blue 1969<br /><br />
          Raemar, Blue is one of the earliest and most significant of Turrell’s
          ‘Shallow Space Constructions’; works which combine architecture,
          sculpture, light and space to completely envelop the viewer in a
          coloured atmosphere. Raemar, Blue is an immersive spatial environment
          that plays with the experience of perception and the effect of light
          in space. The work was first executed in 1968, an important year for
          Turrell which saw him expand the confines of his earlier light
          projections into constructed physical environments. Blue light
          radiates from fluorescent tubes placed behind a partition that appears
          to float at the back of the gallery space.

          Pierre Mignard, Time clipping Cupid's wings (1694)<br /><br />
          In this painting , Mignard depicts an allegorical concept of Time’s
          effect on Love (or rather infatuation) symbolised by the young Cupid.
          Time here is personified in Chronos (Father time wielding a scythe)
          who finds mention in the pre-Socratic philosophy. Chronos was also
          depicted in Greco-Roman mosaics as a man turning the Zodiac Wheel.
          Pierre painted this picture one year prior to his death, at the peak
          of his career.The narrative is that of time’s effect on the longevity
          of love, or even infatuation that is often confused for love.
